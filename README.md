# Note to Server Owners

So did you read one of the first neon lines correctly?

I created this design before NFS French Events design went live. So this is an original design based on Year 2 neon, but without the NFS logo.

If possible make sure to not make this Neon design go live, on the in-game store before July 20. After this date, make the *Year 10* Neon available to everyone to buy in-game.

It will be a nice treat for the community. :)

p.s. You can tease it, just make it settle.
